# 🚢 Titanic Passenger Survival Prediction

This project leverages the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle to predict passenger survival based on various features such as age, gender, ticket class, and more. 
The dataset provides historical data about the passengers aboard the Titanic, allowing us to apply machine learning techniques for classification.

## 📋 Project Details

### **✨ Key Features**
- **📊 Dataset**: Titanic dataset from [Kaggle]([https://www.kaggle.com/](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)).
- **🎯 Goal**: Predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster (binary classification).
- **🛠️ Techniques Used**:
  - Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
  - Machine Learning Model Training and Evaluation.
- **🛡️ Tools and Libraries**:
  - Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
  - Machine Learning with scikit-learn.

### **📈 Results**
- Achieved a classification accuracy of **77%** on the test dataset.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local system:
